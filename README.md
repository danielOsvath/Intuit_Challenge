# Intuit_Challenge

## Install 

### 1) Download project from Github as a .zip. 
(I have invited Intuit-Recruiting on Github as a collaborator.)

**Important:** Please use transaction .csv files from the downloaded .zip from my project, because the original ones for the challenge had a mistake: there were dates 12/32/2013 and 12/32/2014, which caused errors for date formatting libraries, as there is no 32nd day in a month. This has been fixed in the files of my project.

### 2) Download Anaconda â€“ a library for data tools

Download the graphical or command line installer and install, there are specific instructions through the above link when you scroll down. 

## Running (Mac) 

Open **terminal.** 

Before running, make sure the terminal window is at least 350 characters in width, because it outputs a wide table (you may have to do some dragging). **350 x 62** is a good size. 

Type: `python`

If you see:
Python 3.5.2 |Anaconda 4.2.0 (x86_64)| , and the anaconda label is there, you are set to run the project by browsing to the project folder 

and typing: `python readData.py`

If the anaconda label is not there, you will have to provide the anaconda python path. Usually in the following location: ~/anaconda/bin/python.app 

To run: `~/anaconda/bin/python.app readData.py`

When in the project directory. 

In addition to the displayed table, the program will output a .csv in the project folder.
